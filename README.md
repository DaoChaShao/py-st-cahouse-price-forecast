**INTRODUCTION**
---

**California House Price Forecast** is an interactive Streamlit application designed for exploring, visualising,
training, and predicting house prices in California using both single-variable and multi-variable linear regression
models.

**OVERVIEW**
---
This project demonstrates a classic machine learning workflow in a user-friendly web interface:

+ **Model:** A `scikit-learn` Linear Regression model.
+ **Data:** The famous [California Housing Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices)
  dataset.
+ **Frontend:** A beautiful and interactive UI built with `Streamlit`.
+ **Features:** Explore the dataset through dynamic visualisations and get instant price predictions by adjusting
  feature inputs.

**FEATURES**
---

1. **Data Management**

+ Load the California housing dataset (`ca_house_prices.csv`) and preprocess it by removing irrelevant columns (
  `latitude`, `longitude`, `ocean_proximity`).
+ Users can browse the dataset in a read-only interactive table.

2. **Data Visualisation**

+ Visualise relationships between selected features and house prices using scatter charts.

3. **Single-Variable Model Training & Prediction**

+ Select one feature to train a **linear regression model** to predict house prices.
+ Displays key metrics:
    - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
    - **RÂ² Score**
+ Visualises predicted vs actual house prices with scatter charts.
+ Allows users to select a feature value via a slider to make predictions.
+ Users can see the predicted house price along with the difference from the original value in the dataset.

4. **Multi-Variable Model Training & Prediction**

+ Select multiple features to train a **multi-variable linear regression model**.
+ Displays metrics:
    - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
    - **RÂ² Score**
+ Scatter chart shows predicted vs actual house prices for evaluation.
+ Use dynamic sliders for each selected feature to predict house prices interactively.

5. **Session-Based & Interactive**

+ Uses **Streamlit session_state** to manage:
    - Loaded dataset
    - Selected features
    - Trained models
    - Prediction results
+ Supports smooth **multi-page interaction** between Home, Train, and Predict pages.

6. **Technical Stack**

+ Python 3.12
+ Streamlit for UI
+ Pandas for data handling
+ Scikit-learn for linear regression
+ Custom utilities for timing (`Timer`) and plotting (`plotly_scatter`)

**USAGE FLOW**
---

1. Load the dataset on the **Home** page.
2. Inspect the dataset and visualise feature-price relationships.
3. Train a **single-variable model** or **multi-variable model**.
4. Switch to the **Predict** page, adjust feature values with sliders, and get real-time house price predictions.

**CHANGELOG**
---
This guide outlines the steps to automatically generate and maintain a project changelog using git-changelog.

1. Install the required dependencies with the command `pip install git-changelog`.
2. Run the command `pip show git-changelog` or `pip show git-changelog | grep Version` to check whether the changelog
   package has been installed and its version.
3. Prepare the configuration file of `pyproject.toml` at the root of the file.
4. The changelog style is [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
5. Run the command `git-changelog`, creating the `Changelog.md` file.
6. Add the file `Changelog.md` to version control with the command `git add Changelog.md` or using the UI interface.
7. Run the command `git-changelog --output CHANGELOG.md` committing the changes and updating the changelog.
8. Push the changes to the remote repository with the command `git push origin main` or using the UI interface.
